# ZZeus
It's a dll engine extension project launched by RamboPlay and aimed at providing a codec fix for CNCnet5.dll based on [Syringe](https://github.com/Ares-Developers/Syringe).

While ZZeus is independent of Ares by AlexB, you can use Ares, Phobos with using ZZeus.

Currently, usage agreement is the basis of all cooperation. It is not a problem which kind of code hosting is used, We don't want to open source of this dll. But you can use the release binary under License.

ATTENTION: Due to Syringe Dictionary Order, ZZeus must be the last DLL it reads, we highly recommend you do not change the DLL name.
